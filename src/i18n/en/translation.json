If you prefer, you can call me Ju — it’s easier to remember!</p><p>Well, I have a degree in Computer Science from UFS and have been working with Front-end development since 2017. I’m passionate about computer graphics, especially realistic rendering focused on cameras (that’s where my love for photography came from).</p><p>I’m a photographer in my free time, a karateka, and a crocheter. That’s me. And how can someone who loves photography, karate, crochet, computer graphics, and front-end development bring value to you? Send me a message, and I’ll tell you...</p>"
